### Project Description

This is a test project which I've created while learning the language Go. It covers following topics:
- Some basic Go data types
- Type casting
- Loops and conditions
- Maps
- Struct
- Pass by value/reference
- Receiver functions
- User input
- Filesystem interaction

### Functionalities

This is a CLI program that takes input of some menu items and generates a voucher according to the given input. It also can save the formatted voucher in a text file.

### Example output
